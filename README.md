# Ehrenfest-Model
The Ehrenfest model is a classic model in statistical mechanics and probability theory, named after the physicists Paul and Tatiana Ehrenfest. It is used to illustrate the principles of diffusion and the approach to equilibrium in a simple, understandable way.

The Ehrenfest model is a fundamental and intuitive model that provides insights into the behavior of stochastic processes and the principles of statistical mechanics. It demonstrates how a system evolves over time towards equilibrium, illustrating key concepts such as random processes, probability transitions, and equilibrium distribution.

## Key Features:
- Two dogs: The model consists of two dogs labeled A and B.
- N fleas: There are NN balls that can be distributed between the two urns.
- Random jumps: At each discrete time step, one flea chooses at random and with some probability transferred from its current urn to the other urn.

## Example:
Initial state: all 100 fleas on dog A. The evolution of state of dogs is in time going to equilibrium state.

It is normal distribution.
